## CSS422: ARM Assembly Language Programming

This course provided practical experience in low-level programming using ARM assembly language, focusing on foundational concepts in computer architecture and processor design. Through a combination of lectures and hands-on projects, I developed skills in writing and debugging assembly code that interfaces directly with hardware.

The coursework included two major projects, a midpoint and a final project, that presented significant challenges and required applying concepts such as register manipulation, branching, and memory addressing. These projects deepened my understanding of how higher-level code translates to machine instructions and enhanced my ability to work with embedded systems programming.

Technologies and Concepts:
- ARM architecture and instruction set
- Assembly language programming and debugging
- Register and memory management
- Integration with C/C++ code in embedded contexts
